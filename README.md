# MediaCertification

In order to run the program, download the files and place them in one folder. After doing so, click on mediaquiz.html.

The practice questions given for the Premiere Practice Test were taken from https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/5faab480b68ec7001b170d57. 
I can confirm that they are accurate as they cover the same material as the official practice exams.
